# Timbrosa - Elegant Music App

A concise and elegant web-based music player application with a modern UI.

## Features

- Clean, modern interface inspired by popular music streaming services
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Interactive music player with play/pause, track progress, and volume controls
- Featured playlists and recently played tracks sections
- Sidebar navigation for easy access to libraries and playlists

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application, so you only need a modern web browser to run it.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## Usage

- Click on any track card to start playing that track
- Use the player controls at the bottom to play/pause, adjust volume, and track progress
- Click on featured items to open the corresponding playlist
- Navigate through the sidebar to access different sections of the app

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `src/styles/main.css` - All styling for the application
- `src/app.js` - JavaScript for interactivity
- `src/assets/` - Contains all images and artwork

## Note

This is a frontend demo only. In a real application, you would:
- Connect to a backend API for music data and streaming
- Implement user authentication
- Add actual audio playback functionality
- Include a database for storing user preferences and playlists

## Customization

You can easily customize this app by:
- Changing the color scheme in `main.css` (primary color is currently `#1DB954`)
- Adding your own music artwork in the `src/assets/` directory
- Modifying the playlists and track information in `index.html`
